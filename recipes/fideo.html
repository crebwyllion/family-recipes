        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I don't have a picture, so I stole one that looks similar. Another old family recipe (handed down through at least 4 generations!), this is a slightly more decadent take on fideo, using whole pasta and consomme. It's a nice way to dress up a classic comfort food. Probably serves 6.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>
            <ul>4 tablespoons oil</ul>
            <ul>1 large yellow onion, diced</ul>
            <ul>4 to 5 cloves garlic, minced</ul>
            <ul>3 10.5 oz cans beef consomme</ul>
            <ul>1 package vermicelli or angelhair nests</ul>
            <ul>1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes</ul>
            <ul>Sliced cheddar cheese for melting on top</ul>
        </li>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <li>
            <ol>Using a large and deep pan, saute onions in oil until translucent.</ol>
            <ol>Add garlic and saute for 3 minutes, taking care not to burn the garlic.</ol>
            <ol>Move onions and garlic aside or remove from pan. Leave oil and brown coils. Browning coils on both sides adds to the flavor, so don't skip this part.</ol>
            <ol>Add consomme over the coils and return the onion mixture to the pan.</ol>
            <ol>Add can of tomatoes and let fideo cook until until the consomme is absorbed.</ol>
            <ol>Once the consomme has been absorbed, cover the top with cheese and let it melt.</ol>
            <ol>Eat it.</ol>
        </li>
